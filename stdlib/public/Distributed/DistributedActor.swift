// ==== Distributed Actor -----------------------------------------------------

/// Common protocol to which all distributed actors conform implicitly.
///
/// It is not possible to conform to this protocol manually explicitly.
/// Only a 'distributed actor' declaration or protocol with 'DistributedActor'
/// requirement may conform to this protocol.
///
/// The 'DistributedActor' protocol provides the core functionality of any
/// distributed actor.
///
/// ## Implicit `Codable` conformance
/// If created with an actor system whose `ActorID` is `Codable`, the
/// compiler will synthesize code for the concrete distributed actor to conform
/// to `Codable` as well. This is necessary to support distributed calls where
/// the `SerializationRequirement` is `Codable` and thus users may want to pass
/// actors as arguments to remote calls.
///
/// The synthesized implementations use a single `SingleValueContainer` to
/// encode/decode the `self.id` property of the actor. The `Decoder` required
/// `init(from:)` is implemented by retrieving an actor system from the
/// decoders' `userInfo`, effectively like this:
/// `decoder.userInfo[.actorSystemKey] as? ActorSystem`. The obtained actor
/// system is then used to `resolve(id:using:)` the decoded ID.
///
/// Use the `CodingUserInfoKey.actorSystemKey` to provide the necessary
/// actor system for the decoding initializer when decoding a distributed actor.

  /// to return the same exact resolved actor instance, however all the references would
  /// represent logically references to the same distributed actor, e.g. on a different node.

  /// a local instance or request a proxy to be created for this identity.
  ///

  /// the system, allowing it to take over the remote messaging with the
  /// remote actor instance.
